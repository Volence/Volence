                                        <p class="paragraph">
                                                It all started many years ago when I was around the age of 14. At the time I was a big fan of Sonic the Hedgehog and was
                                                first starting to explore the internet. I wound up stumbling on a community
                                                that was focussed on studying the games and finding hidden levels. Eventually
                                                the community even took some of the first few Sonic games and broke them
                                                down to a basic assembly language (Motorola 68000). I joined the community
                                                and my quest at the time to create new bosses for the sonic games lead me
                                                to learning the language and all about programming at a lower level. I've
                                                even worked with a friend on a custom game engine that was able to run on
                                                the Sega Genesis hardware!

                                        <h3 class="heading-tertiary u-margin-bottom-small">Right before the big break</h3>
                                        <p class="paragraph">
                                                After learning quite a bit on my own, I wanted to continue to learn programming and possibly expand to a language that wasn't
                                                last used professionally over ten years ago, so my senior year of high school
                                                I signed up for Computer Programming 1. Throughout the year we studied Visual
                                                Basics and I was able to play with a much higher level language than I was
                                                used to. For my final project I made a 2D sidescroller game which had impressed
                                                my teacher so much I won an award for outstanding achievement in computer
                                                science! Once high school was over I wound up going to community college
                                                for a year for comuputer science but alas, I found a passion grow in a different
                                                direction and switched to a trade school for music production.

                                        <p class="paragraph">
                                                After a few years of not finding the right path for myself, I moved from northern New Jersey to Philadelphia and started
                                                a new life here. I've been working in the restaurant industry as well for
                                                several years and have decided that the long hours, inconsistant pay, and
                                                various other things wouldn't be truly sufficient in the long run. Trying
                                                to figure out what else I could do I decided to take a look again towards
                                                my old passion of programming. Doing so I found several resources to help
                                                teach myself quite a bit of knowledge in web development and once again found
                                                my passion reignite. Every day for the past 8 months I've generally spent
                                                at least 3 to 8 hours learning more concepts and bettering my skills. After
                                                a few months I created my first website for a friend, which was extremely
                                                rewarding to me. While I still have a lot to learn I'm hoping to put more
                                                and more of what I've learned into practice and gain experience along the
                                                way.

My current skills include HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, Javascript, and JQUERY, although I have just started delving into REACT as well. Besides that I have made projects using wordpress (including an ecomerce store).</p>
